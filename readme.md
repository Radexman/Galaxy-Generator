# Galaxy Generator

## Summary

The **Galaxy Generator** is an artistic project built with JavaScript and Three.js that allows users to create stunning, star-filled galaxies. Leveraging particle effects, the app generates hundreds of thousands of stars in real-time, enabling users to create and customize their own galaxies. Users can adjust the number of stars, add new segments to the galaxy, change colors, and even fine-tune the spiral effect to create visually captivating, dynamic galaxies. The project is designed to showcase impressive graphical effects, allowing users to generate up to 1,000,000 stars without sacrificing rendering performance.
